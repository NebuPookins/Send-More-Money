# This file allows you to configure the behaviour of the SendMoreMoney app, as
# well as the Akka platform as a whole. This file uses the HOCON format, which
# is documented at https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md
#
# At the top level, this file is split into two sections: "send-more-money",
# which configures settings specific to this environment, and "akka", which
# configures settings that are global to the akka environment.

send-more-money {
	# This application requies an acccess token to the Twitter API in order to
	# make API requests. You can get an access token for free by following these
	# steps.
	#
	# 1. Go to https://dev.twitter.com/
	# 2. Sign in (click in the top right corner)
	# 3. Create a new app. You can name it whatever you like, e.g. "Send More
	#    Money". The app only needs read access, so you do not need to generate a
	#    read-write token (though you can, if you want).
	# 4. Click "Generate Access Token"
	# 5. Copy the consumer key, consumer secret, access token and access token
	#    secret into the twitter-authentication section immediately below.

	# on your computer. For example, set this to 8 if you have 8 cores.
	number-of-sum-checkers = 8

	# dictionary-file is a list of files that contain words you're interested in
	# testing against. For example, these could be a list of all English words,
	# with one word per line. The files are specified as paths. The paths can be
	# relative to the current directory or absolute. If you specify a file and
	# the file does not exist, a warning will be displayed and the file will be
	# skipped.

	# from the dictionary files. For example, if the minimum-word-length is set to

	# present in the dictionary file.

	# operands in a puzzle, e.g. "THE + THE = WHAT", where both the left and right
	# operands of the addition are the same word.

	# allow-non-unique-solutions determines whether or not you want to allow
	# puzzles which have multiple solutions. For example "FROM + WITH = THEY" has
	# 5219 + 3487 = 8706, 1609 + 3248 = 4857, 3419 + 5287 = 8706, and more
	# solutions.

	# max-solutions-to-print controls how many solutions to print when printing
	# the puzzles. If you don't want to print any solutions at all (e.g. you want
	# to try solving the puzzles yourself) you can set this value to 0.
	max-solutions-to-print = 3

	# logging messages are displayed. All of these logging messages are sent at
	# the "DEBUG" level, so you'll need to set akka.loglevel to at least "DEBUG"
